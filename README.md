- **Skill Set**: Proficient in C, C++, and Python, with hands-on experience in network security protocols, Linux kernel development, and embedded systems.
- **Interests**: Wireless security, privacy protocols, and networked system optimization.


## [MSc Thesis – Enhancing Privacy in Wireless Communications](https://github.com/raghava-2002/backports_project)

**AP-Initiated Dynamic MAC Re-Randomization**

- Developed a Dynamic MAC re-randomization protocol in the Linux kernel to address WiFi tracking risks.
- Integrated wmediumd and Mininet-WiFi to simulate real-world scenarios, achieving high privacy without compromising network performance.
- Conducted tests to analyze network impact, visualizing MAC transitions and linking accuracy.
- **Support Repository:** [Check out](https://github.com/raghava-2002/Hwsim_test_backport_project) for additional testing resources.

## Other Projects

- **Building Networked Systems Security**: Designed a secure VPN-based network for remote data exchange, utilizing **OpenVPN**, **OpenSSL**, **Docker**, and **RADIUS** for secure access control.
- **Facial Recognition Attendance System**: Built an automated attendance system using **OpenCV**, **face-recognition**.
